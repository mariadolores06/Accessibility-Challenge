#Accessibility Challenge 

##Description

This challenge was created for a junior developer to fulfill a common task of refactoring code for a business. An important aspect of web development is accessibility. A marketing agency wants their site to follow accessibility standards while also ensuring their site is optimized for search engines. The junior developer was given a starter code where they added semantic HTML elements and accessibile alt attributes. There is a screenshot included of what the site should look like.
